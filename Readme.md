## Learning Objectives

Demonstrate a full understanding of AngularJS, Models, ViewModels, Controllers and UI Router
Demonstrate an understanding of how to build an application from scratch

## Normal Mode

* You'll need at least three routes (wireframes below)
  * [Home Page](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/42180927-home.png) - this will show a list of all images
  * [Detail Page](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/f3a0cc17-detail.png) - this will be a detailed view of your image
  * [Add Page](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/43c41d22-add.png) - this will be a page where you can upload another image

* Also, add a like button to your image and track how many likes happen on a specific image. This can happen by "double-clicking" on an image like on Instagram, or you can actually add a small "like" or "heart" button that can be manually pressed. See an example below, but you can implement this anyway.
* Show the count on both the home view as an overlay on the image and on the detail view.
* Note: All of the data needs to be persistent. You should use the class server to store the data.
* I suggest using Bulma or Bootstrap to help with layout, though not at all required.

## Hard Mode

* Add a 4th route that takes you to an edit view (same as the add view) where you can change the description of the image.
* Also, add in the ability to delete the image

## Deliverables

* A link to your repo.
* A link to your deployed `surge.sh`page.
